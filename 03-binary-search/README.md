# Binary Search
---
**A binary search is a computer science algorithm that searches for an item in a sorted array.**

**It starts in the middle of an array and checks whether the middle item is less than, equal to, or greater than the number for which you are searching.**

**If the number is smaller, the algorithm knows to keep searching in the left half of the array, where the smaller numbers are; if the number is larger, the algorithm will focus on the right half of the array. Binary searches only work on sorted lists.**

**Binary searches are more efficient than linear searches. This is because every time a search is made the number of items left to search in the list is reduced by half.**
