# Queues
---
**Queues are very similar to stacks however they use the “first-in-first- out” paradigm. This means that the oldest element (the element that was added first) is the next item to be removed.**

**We can picture a queue like a queue of people waiting to buy movie tickets. The person who has been waiting in line the longest is the next person to be serviced.**
