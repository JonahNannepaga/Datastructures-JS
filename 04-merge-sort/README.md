# Merge Sort

---

**Merge sort is a “divide and conquer” algorithm which means it divides its input array into two halves and recursively calls itself on each half, then merges the two sorted halves back together**

**The mergeSort function is responsible for splitting the array into smaller sub-arrays while the merge function is the function which sorts the arrays**

**The time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n)**
